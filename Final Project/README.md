WeSet Documentation


WeSet, a homework/pset partner/essay buddy matching website for laptop/desktop, is hosted on CS50 IDE, and as such, compiling and running my project is simple. It runs on a combination of HTML, JS, and Flask with Python, and thus to create an instance of the page
you will just need to cd into the "implementation" directory in your terminal instance and then execute the "flask run" command. The resulting link will take you to a CS50 IDE hosted instance of
my page, where you will land on the login screen.

Now that you have my project up and running, you can begin your interaction with it. Begin my registering your profile with the site, creating a valid username and password, and then using it to
login. This will land you on the login page again, where you can use your new credentials to access your profile. From here, you will see that you need to upload preferences, or else, you won't
be able to see any homework partner matches. You can enter in your preferences by clicking on the preferences tab. Here, you can enter your information, taking care to check the online checkbox,
since to get matches, you need to be online (actively searching for a partner)! With your info entered, you, can hit update and get redirected back to the dashboard.

Take a minute to appreciate that styling! Very cute. Now you see a list of your matches, sorted by online, if you're just looking for a general work buddy who has similar work patterns as you, or
you can look at matches for people within your concentration who are taking the same classes - a good way to meet people in your classes that have similar interests and likely similar background
for the material you'll be working on. At the time of this project's completion, these are the only two categories I had time to fully implement, but you could imagine a host of different
combinations; however, these are likely the most effective, in my and my classmates' perspectives, and thus I chose to implement these two sets of lists. Note that contact info that other people
want shared is made available - go ahead and reach out if you're interested! :)

You can go back into preferences at any time to edit your info. Note that any info you entered previously will be remembered - very handy! All edits will be saved upon hitting "Update". You can
also logout at any time and all your info will still be there upon your next login. Happy studying!
